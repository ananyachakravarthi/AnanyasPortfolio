<!--Accessibility considerations
Opening links in a new tab or window can cause accessibility issues. Here are some reasons why: Links opening in a new tab can prove disorienting for people with low vision or are navigating via screen reader, especially when there is no warning. However, using iframe to package content within a modal also raises accessibility concerns-->

     </a>
        <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;"> Design Fuego was a great way to get our feet wet in the digital design realm. It allowed us to understand how html and web design worked without overwhelming the students that had no background in the material. It even gave the students an idea on their perception of what "good design" is which guided the next couple of projects in the course.</p>

              </div>
     </a>
        <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;"> Personally, I interpreted the A/B/C project very differently to my peers. Instead of making a logo that gave the audience a sense of who I am, I instead made 3 logos that represented my interests in the world as if thet were real companies. Regardles, I thoroughly enjoyed the process of using canva as well as my first time using adobe. It was a creative awakening seeing all the tools that I had at my disposal. </p>

              </div>
     </a>
        <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;"> The UX research was an elightening way to get feedback without overwhelming the designers with critiques. Since design is very subjective, it also allowed us to keep in mind the goals we want with our logos rather than only change what our participants wanted us to. Personally, I definetly took some advice with a grain of salt, and others, I kept in mind. My final logo represented me much more than my preliminary designs, and I am glad to have gotten the feedback I did. </p>

            </div>
          </a>
              <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;"> The Cartoon design was one the most challenging for me thus far. It took me a while to get the hang of using adobe and layering. It doesn't help that I'm not the most creative individual, so figuring out what exactly I wanted to include and not include was difficult. When I have the time later on in the term, I plan on tweaking it to be more realisitic and less "creepy".</p>

            </div>
          </a>
              <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;"> Our last project of design beginnings was our "good design" piece. I very much love this type of graphic design as it's clean and neat without being boring. I chose my artwork as one that was important to me as an individual. It portrayed an important matter as well as made it aesthetically pleasing. It had all the elements of proximity, alignment, and color choice that was discussed in class, making it an overall solid piece of work. </p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;"> Rhetoric allows me to convey complex ideas clearly, whether in communicating scientific insights, providing critical information to patients, or visually representing themes like sustainability, as seen in my design projects, especially in my "good design". Technology serves as a bridge, enabling medical and biological advances through computational tools and enriching my design capabilities. Ethics ensures that my work, from handling genomic data to respecting patient autonomy and promoting truthful design, aligns with values of integrity and respect. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;"><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">I leverage design principles to enhance communication, clarity, and impact across diverse fields. In the "Pre-hospital care" logo, I used simplicity and symbolism to instantly convey the compassion and support central to emergency medical services—key elements in a field where clear, quick recognition is essential. Similarly, in the "Locally Sourced" project, I applied balance, typography hierarchy, and negative space to create a calm, organized layout that reinforces the themes of sustainability and authenticity, appealing to viewers values.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
             <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;"><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;"> As a designer, I lead creative workshops where I facilitate brainstorming sessions, gather diverse perspectives, and refine design concepts collaboratively, as demonstrated in my projects, especially my Design Fuego and even my cartoon. These experiences across different fields have honed my ability to adapt to various group dynamics, contribute meaningfully to multidisciplinary teams, and leverage each workshop opportunity to achieve impactful and cohesive results.</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">Practicing revision across media forms in my role as a student has taught me how different approaches can enhance a project’s clarity and impact. Whether revising a written assignment or redesigning a visual presentation, adapting content across formats allows for better communication and engagement. I got a ton of well deserved feedback for my cartoon project and I tweaked a lot of small issues that showed.  </p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;"> Through presentations in class, Ive discovered the importance of tailoring content to the audience and clearly articulating the thought process behind a project. Whether sharing design ideas or research findings, presenting allows me to showcase my work while receiving valuable feedback for improvement. With Design Fuego, I was a little concerned to show the class, however, as the class went on, the more comfortable I got.</p>

        <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">Building more using InDesign, I found my artistic side coming out with this project. I tried to find a cover that was fun and hip but also had the color scheme I desired. I really enjoyed the art I chose and I think it fits my personality very well.</p>

     </a>
        <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">Deciding what to portray in my resume came easier to me than deciding how I wanted to lay it out in InDesign. I knew that the organizational side of me wanted a grid like structure, so that's what I did, and I am very proud of how it turned out. </p>

    </a>
       <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">I am one of the few raiders fans left in this country, so the minute the project was pitched in class, I knew I wanted to do something that showed my *unfortunate* pride in my team. Building more in Indesign, I've gotten much more comfortable with the tools. I imported some fonts to make it more visually appealing and I think it turned out better than expected.</p>

   </a>
      <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">I thoroughly enjoyed this client project. It gave me the chance to treat my design and creative process as practice for the real world. Using one of my bosses as the client also gave me a chance to promote respect and collaboration. She loved the designs I came up with for a new hire flyer and is eager to put it up on our website.</p>

               <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">The projects I've made in my short form demonstrate how rhetoric and ethics play a vital role in design, especially for communication purposes. In the two page spread, for instance, rhetoric is used to disrupt traditional views, creating a visually and emotionally engaging ad that speaks to a rebellious, younger demographic. Meanwhile, ethics are considered subtly in design choices, ensuring the ad does not alienate traditional wine audiences while appealing to new customers.</p>

     <div class="col-sm-4">

               <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">Each design leverages core design principles effectively. The EMS recruitment poster uses hierarchy, contrast, and alignment to communicate information clearly, helping readers quickly understand job benefits and application instructions. For example, the bolded job titles and benefits package highlight key details, drawing immediate attention. The resume leverages alignment, contrast, and spacing effectively to guide the reader’s eye and emphasize different sections (like "Experience" and "Skills"). The design is clean and professional, with a simple monochromatic color scheme that reflects a serious, academic tone, aligning with my career goals.</p>
     </div>
 
     <div class="col-sm-4">
              <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;"><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
               <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">In previous iterations of the Raiders poster, I made several changes to improve its visual impact and alignment with the team’s branding. Initially, the design had less contrast and didn’t fully capture the bold, intense vibe that represents Raiders culture. After receiving feedback, I adjusted the color balance and added stronger contrasts to emphasize the “Silver & Black” theme, aligning more closely with the Raiders' iconic brand.</p>

               <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">The designs exhibit skills that can be applied across different media. For instance, the EMS recruitment ad could transition to a digital format for online recruitment, incorporating animation for additional engagement. Similarly, the wine advertisement could be adapted into an interactive webpage or social media format, where movement could be enhanced through animation to simulate the wine pouring effect.</p>

 <div class="col-sm-4">
    <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;"> <em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">The principles of color harmony, typography, and layout guided the development of each project. For instance, in the "Brand Redesign Research," I incorporated user feedback to refine color palettes and typography, ensuring that every design choice enhanced clarity and brand alignment. In the spread, I used balanced layouts and vibrant colors to create an engaging visual hierarchy. For the bioinformatics project, the focus was on accessibility, employing colorblind-friendly schemes and intuitive interface designs. These principles ensured the effectiveness and inclusivity of my work across different contexts.</p>

    <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;"><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">Collaboration was central to my brand redesign project, where I engaged with participants during feedback sessions. By gathering insights from diverse individuals, I refined design elements like logos, fonts, and slogans to better align with user needs. This iterative process mirrors a workshop environment where ideas are shared, critiqued, and improved collectively. In other projects, such as the accessible bioinformatics tools, collaboration with peers helped ensure that the final outputs met both technical and ethical standards.</p>
